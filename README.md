## Getting Started with HTML5 Blank

* Go to the Wordpress' theme folder (`.../wp-content/themes`)
* In CLI, run: `git clone https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank.git`
* `cd html5blank` and then `npm install` and then `bower install` (you'll need gulp install as well)
* `gulp watch` will enable `livereload` and development version
* `gulp build` for distribute version with minified `js` and `css` files
* NOTE: `src` and `dist` folders can live happily together inside the same folder (`html5blank`) that in the `theme` folder. You'll have two different instances of the theme within `Appearance > Themes` panel inside the admin
